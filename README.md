# Idegram - IDEA Telegram plugin

Now you can use Telegram messenger right from IntelliJ IDEA.

Find plugin in IDEA's marketplace and install it.

Hope that this project helps developers to communicate.

Feel free to join us at [this group](https://t.me/intellijitelegram) on Telegram.

## How you can help

First of all I want to improve auth part and general look and feel of plugin.
Also project needs integration with Windows.
Join Telegram group to discuss it.
